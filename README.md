## Introduction

The Face Recognition Attendance System is a project that aims to automate the attendance management process using face recognition technology. The system captures images of individuals, processes them to detect and recognize faces, records attendance data, and stores it in both Excel sheets and a SQL database.

## Features

- Face detection and recognition using OpenCV.
- Graphical User Interface (GUI) built with Tkinter for easy interaction.
- Excel sheets are used to store attendance data.
- SQL database integration for efficient data management.
- User-friendly and intuitive interface for both administrators and users.

## Requirements

- Python (>= 3.6)
- OpenCV
- Tkinter
- pandas
- mysqlconnector
